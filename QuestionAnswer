Q) What is the use of @Required annotation
The @Required annotation is used in the Spring Framework to indicate that the annotated
element (usually a setter method) is required to be injected with a value, and
it should not be null. It's often used in the context of dependency injection and bean configuration.



Q)Difference between Controller and RestController
@RestController:
1) The @RestController annotation is a specialized version of the @Controller annotation.
2) Controllers annotated with @RestController are typically used for building RESTful web services or APIs.
3) Controller methods annotated with @RestController automatically
apply the @ResponseBody annotation to their return values.


Q) Difference in Hibernate and JpaReposiory with Example
Hibernate is a more comprehensive ORM framework that can be used independently, whereas Spring Data
JPA, including JpaRepository, is a part of the Spring ecosystem, which simplifies data
access using JPA. Spring Data JPA builds on top of JPA and reduces the amount of boilerplate code.
Example:
Hibernate query
List<Employee> employees = session.createQuery("from Employee", Employee.class).list();

Spring Data JPA query
List<Employee> findByLastName(String lastName);
